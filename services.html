            <h2>Monitoring health services</h2>
            <p>
                Countries are facing a multitude of questions that must be addressed to prepare for and respond to COVID-19 while maintaining other essential health services across the life course. Key decisions and actions must be informed by accurate and timely data on health service delivery and utilization throughout all phases of the COVID-19 pandemic. As such, WHO is coordinating efforts to support countries to strengthen continuous health system and service monitoring in the context of COVID-19 at national, facility and community levels.

            <h4>National pulse survey on continuity of essential health services</h4>
            <p>
                The national pulse survey provides a rapid snapshot into the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on essential health services across countries. It provides key informant insight into country policies, plans and mechanisms to support continuity of essential health services, the extent of service disruptions across the health system, reasons for disruptions, and strategies that countries are using to mitigate service disruptions.
