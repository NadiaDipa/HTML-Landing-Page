                <h3>Is the COVID-19 vaccine safe for children?</h3>
                <p>Clinical trials have shown the Pfizer vaccine to be both safe and effective when used to prevent COVID-19 in children ages 5 to 11. <br>
                A COVID-19 vaccine can prevent your child from getting and spreading the virus that causes COVID-19.

                If your child gets COVID-19, a COVID-19 vaccine could prevent him or her from becoming severely ill or experiencing short-term or long-term complications. Children with other health conditions, such as obesity, diabetes and asthma, might be at higher risk of serious illness with COVID-19.
                <br>
                <br>
                Getting a COVID-19 vaccine can also help keep your child in school and more safely have playdates and participate in sports and other group activities.

                The dosage for the Pfizer vaccine includes two doses of 10 micrograms each, 21 days apart. This is a smaller dose than the 30 micrograms used for those 12 years and older. Children in the clinical trial achieved an effective immune response comparable to the antibody levels seen in earlier trials for those 16 to 25 years of age.
                <br>
                Children ages 5 to 11 who received the Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine had side effects similar to those experienced by people aged 12 and older. These include pain where the shot was given, fatigue, headaches, muscle and joint pain and fever. Local and systemic reactions were less in the 5-11-year-old patients that received the 10-microgram dose compared to patients 16â€“25-years-old who received the 30-microgram dose.  Side effects are usually mild and should only last 1 to 2 days.
